# Group project 
## Name: SearchParty 
## Description: 
Search and rescue party companion app. The app will create an instance
of the SearchParty which will then provide the host with a sharable token/link.
This can then be input by any other of the party volunteers to join the instance.
The app will ping the gps location periodically so that it can trace on a Google Map 
where the user has been already. This location will then be used with other user's locations
To create composite route that shows where all of the users in the SearchParty have been.
In this way, users can keep track of where everyone has searched and can focus on areas that
Have not yet been visited.


## Main features
1. User must be able to instantiate a new SearchParty on an external server.
2. Instance of SearchParty must be able to handle adding/removing users.
3. Users will have a map displaying the route they have taken.
4. Users can call for a complete map that shows all of the users' path in one map.
5. Provides users with settings to adjust GPS/search parameters. (EX. time b/w pings, search radius)
6. Function to insert pin on location with details included.

## Mockup
Map displaying the paths and current positions of the users.
