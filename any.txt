Considerations and special cases to take into account.

Did all members must have been add to the party before starting the tracing?
If not, what will happen when someone attempts to join in the middle?

How will the tracing process is going to work?
    What are the initial conditions to start tracing?
    --> All members must have been added before start tracing the routes.
    --> It should be internet connection (obviously)
    startTracing();
        1. The server will start the tracing.
        2. All members should be informed of this and the app UI properly updated.
        3. If connection keeps alive and tracing active.
            3.1 User: Send user location data to server. 
                   sendLocation(Location l);
            3.2 Server: Receive user location, Get info of the status of every other member and its current location.
            
 What data does the map need to start drawing paths or routes?
What information about the party do members need to know at every moment?
